**EUNN: Efficient Universal Neural Network**

**Introduction**

The Efficient Universal Neural Network (EUNN) is a groundbreaking architecture that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to achieve exceptional performance while maintaining efficiency.

**Architecture**

The EUNN consists of the following key components:

* **Hybrid Convolutional Layers:** A series of convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes and strides, capturing both local and global features. These layers are designed to be lightweight and computationally efficient.
* **Transformer Blocks:** Transformer blocks, inspired by the popular Transformer model, are introduced to capture long-range dependencies in the data. These blocks utilize self-attention mechanisms to learn relationships between elements in the input.
* **Depthwise Separable Convolutions:** Depthwise separable convolutions are employed to reduce computational cost while maintaining representational capacity. These convolutions decompose standard convolutions into two steps, making them more efficient.
* **Adaptive Pooling:** Adaptive pooling layers dynamically adjust their pooling size based on the input size, allowing the model to adapt to different input dimensions.

**Advantages**

* **Efficiency:** The EUNN's lightweight convolutional layers and efficient transformer blocks minimize computational cost, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.
* **Power:** The combination of convolutional and transformer layers enables the EUNN to capture both local and global features, resulting in superior performance on a wide range of tasks.
* **Adaptability:** Adaptive pooling layers allow the EUNN to handle varying input dimensions, enhancing its versatility.

**Applications**

The EUNN is well-suited for a variety of applications, including:

* Image classification and object detection
* Natural language processing
* Time series analysis
* Medical image analysis
